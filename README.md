A bunch of minor tweaks to the controls and settings of Team Fortess 2 that I have acquired over the years to match my preferences. A lot of these configurations were not written by me.  

<b>Null Cancelling</b> - Normally if you press A and D at the same time, you stop moving. This instead has you move in the direction of whichever one was pressed last. Allows for tighter juking.  

<b>Crouch Jump</b> - Rebinds the spacebar to both jump and crouch, allowing you to get over slightly higher obstacles. Note this is not enabled for sniper, so that you can jump to quickly exit the scope.  

<b>C Tap</b> - Holding down mouse 2 will crouch and will rebind mouse 1 to shoot and to jump. Used to help with the timing of C Tapping, which allows you to rocket jump slightly higher.  

<b>Sap</b> - When the spy uses his sapper, his will automatically message "Sapping" in team chat. The message is only send on the first use of the sapper after each switch to it in order to prevent accidental chat spam. 

<b>Scope Removal</b> - Sets the transparency of the scope viewmodel to almost zero when zoomed in. Also requires a change to hudanimations_tf.txt to work.  

<b>Sticky Spam</b> - Same idea as null-cancelling strafing. You can hold down mouse 2 and tap mouse 1 and your stickies will detonate as soon as possible.  

<b>Training Mode</b> - Adds hotkeys and server settings that make it a little bit easier to practice rocket jumps, such as time controls, noclip, and passive health and ammo regen.
